You are part of a group with 3 members (you and two randomly selected other participants). Each group has the possibility to conduct a project, call project A. If you do not conduct the project each group member receives a payoff of 0 euro for the project. If your group conducts project A, then each group member receives his or her private valuation for the project as payment. The private valuation of project A can be different for each member of your group. If your group decides not to conduct project A, all group members receive a payoff of zero. The individual participants can not identify the other group members. Thus, you will not know which other participants are in your group. The decision has two parts. In the first part, each group picks a decision rule to decide on implementing project A or not. In the second part, your group applies the chosen rule to decide on project A. You will be informed about your private valuation for project A after part one. We will now explain to you the two different parts of each round as well as the possible decision rules in detail. 

In part one you have the choice between two different decision rules, which will be used to determine whether project A is implemented or not, in part two. Each of the three group members suggests one of the two available rules for part two of this round. A computer randomly picks one of these suggestions as group rule. This decision rule determines how in part 2 the question whether project A is implemented or not is resolved. Each group member has the same chance for his or her suggestion to be selected. Please note that the decision rule is important, because dependent on the decision rule the implementation of project A is easier or more difficult. The different rules are explained below.

In part 2 the selected decision rule is used to determine whether project A is implemented or not. The group decision arises directly from the decisions of all group members in part 2. The decision is announced and each participants is informed about his or her payment.

In case project A is implemented all group members receive a payment depended on their project valuations. This means, if your valuation for project A is positive, you benefit from the implementation of project A, and when your valuation for project A is negative, then you have to pay if the project is implemented. You learn your valuation after part 1. Therefore you do not know your valuation when you decide between the different decision rules in part 1, but you know your valuation in part 2 when you decide about the implementation of project A according to the selected decision rule. If your group does not implement project A, each group member receives 0 euro, meaning you neither gain nor lose anything, independently of your valuation for project A
