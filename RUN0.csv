In the first part, each group picks a decision rule to decide on implementing project A or not. In the second part, your group applies the chosen rule to decide on project A. You will be informed about your private valuation for project A after part one. We will now explain to you the two different parts of each round as well as the possible decision rules in detail. \n\nIn part one you have the choice between two different decision rules, which will be used to determine whether project A is implemented or not, in part two. Each of the three group members suggests one of the two available rules for part two of this round. A computer randomly picks one of these suggestions as group rule. This decision rule determines how in part 2 the question whether project A is implemented or not is resolved. Each group member has the same chance for his or her suggestion to be selected. Please note that the decision rule is important, because dependent on the decision rule the implementation of project A is easier or more difficult. The different rules are explained below.\n\nIn part 2 the selected decision rule is used to determine whether project A is implemented or not. The group decision arises directly from the decisions of all group members in part 2. The decision is announced and each participants is informed about his or her payment.\n\nIn case project A is implemented all group members receive a payment depended on their project valuations. This means, if your valuation for project A is positive, you benefit from the implementation of project A, and when your valuation for project A is negative, then you have to pay if the project is implemented. You learn your valuation after part 1. Therefore you do not know your valuation when you decide between the different decision rules in part 1, but you know your valuation in part 2 when you decide about the implementation of project A according to the selected decision rule. If your group does not implement project A, each group member receives 0 euro, meaning you neither gain nor lose anything, independently of your valuation for project A\n\n\n\n the valuation of each group member can be -3 euro, -1 euro, +1 eurp, +3 euro.

If the coin flip results in HEADS, the project is implemented. If the coin flip is TAILS, the project is not implemented. Both results, HEADS and TAILS, are equally likely.\n Rule 2 = Simple majority vote (SM): At least two group members have to vote for the implementation of project A.

2. The theoretical optimal Arrow-d'Aspremont-Gerard-Varet (AGV): The implementation of project A depends on the stated valuations of all group members. If the sum of all valuations is greater than 0, project A is implemented. Additionally, transfer payments between group members occur based on the stated valuations.

In the first part, each group picks a decision rule to decide on implementing project A or not. In the second part, your group applies the chosen rule to decide on project A. You will be informed about your private valuation for project A after part one. We will now explain to you the two different parts of each round as well as the possible decision rules in detail. \n\nIn part one you have the choice between two different decision rules, which will be used to determine whether project A is implemented or not, in part two. Each of the three group members suggests one of the two available rules for part two of this round. A computer randomly picks one of these suggestions as group rule. This decision rule determines how in part 2 the question whether project A is implemented or not is resolved. Each group member has the same chance for his or her suggestion to be selected. Please note that the decision rule is important, because dependent on the decision rule the implementation of project A is easier or more difficult. The different rules are explained below.\n\nIn part 2 the selected decision rule is used to determine whether project A is implemented or not. The group decision arises directly from the decisions of all group members in part 2. The decision is announced and each participants is informed about his or her payment.\n\nIn case project A is implemented all group members receive a payment depended on their project valuations. This means, if your valuation for project A is positive, you benefit from the implementation of project A, and when your valuation for project A is negative, then you have to pay if the project is implemented. You learn your valuation after part 1. Therefore you do not know your valuation when you decide between the different decision rules in part 1, but you know your valuation in part 2 when you decide about the implementation of project A according to the selected decision rule. If your group does not implement project A, each group member receives 0 euro, meaning you neither gain nor lose anything, independently of your valuation for project A\n\n\n\n the valuation of each group member can be -7 euro, -1 euro, +1 euro, +3 euro. All values are equally likely \n Rule 1 = Simple majority vote (SM): At least two group members have to vote for the implementation of project A. In part II all group members vote either for or against the implementation of project A. At least 2 group members have to vote for the implementation, otherwise project A is not implemented.\n\n Rule 2 = The theoretical optimal Arrow-d'Aspremont-Gerard-Varet (AGV): Whether project A is implemented or not depends on the stated valuations of all group members. With this decision rule in part 2 each group member states his or her valuation for the project. If the sum of all statements is larger than 0, then project A is implemented. If the sum is smaller, the project is not implemented. Each participant has to state a possible valuation. He or she can state his or her true valuation, but also any other possible valuation. The calculation of the sum only depends on the stated valuations true valuations are not taken into account. \n\nAdditionally to the payments from an implementation of project A there are transfer payments between the group members with this decision rule.

Rule 1 (Simple majority vote): At least two group members have to vote for the implementation of project A. This means that if one person does not want to implement the project, it will not be carried out.

Therefore, my chosen rule = AGV","We need to consider the optimal strategy in this situation.

Given that our private valuation is +3 euro, it would be strategically optimal to state our true valuation in order to potentially maximize transfer payments. 

Therefore, in this case, the optimal strategy would be to state the true valuation of +3 euro.

Rule 2 (Flipping a random coin): This rule relies on the outcome of a coin flip to determine whether or not project A is implemented. This means that the decision is based purely on chance, with each outcome having an equal probability.

For Rule 1 (Simple majority vote):
- If I have a positive valuation (+1 or +7 euro), I would want to choose Rule 1 because then I have a higher chance of the project being implemented if at least two group members also have positive valuations.
- If I have a negative valuation (-3 or -1 euro), I would still prefer Rule 1 because there is a chance that at least two other group members have positive valuations and vote for the project to be implemented.

For Rule 2 (Flipping a random coin):
- If I have a positive valuation, I might not want to choose Rule 2 because there is only a 50% chance that the project will be implemented, regardless of others' valuations.
- If I have a negative valuation, I might prefer Rule 2 because there is a 50% chance that the project will not be implemented, and I won't have to pay for a project that I don't value positively.

Based on these considerations, I would choose Rule 1 (Simple majority vote) because it gives me a better chance of the project being implemented if I have a positive valuation and a chance of not implementing it if I have a negative valuation.

Under Arrow-d'Aspremont-Gerard-Varet (AGV), the decision to implement project A depends on the sum of all stated valuations. If the sum is larger than 0, project A is implemented. This rule also involves transfer payments between group members based on the stated valuations.

Given the potential for transfer payments and the fact that the sum of valuations determines the outcome under AGV, it may be more advantageous to choose this rule. This is because AGV takes into account the valuations of all group members, potentially allowing for a more informed and collaborative decision-making process.

Therefore, based on the potential benefits of including all valuations in the decision-making process, I would choose the AGV rule.

Conclude with: ""chosen_rule=AGV""","Since the AGV rule takes into account the stated valuations of all group members to determine whether the project is implemented or not, it would be beneficial to state a valuation that aligns with the potential for the project to be implemented. In this case, since my private valuation is -1 euro, and in order for the sum of stated valuations to be larger than 0 (for project implementation), I should state a valuation that, when combined with others, can lead to a positive sum.

Therefore, my best strategy would be to state a positive valuation, such as +1 euro, to contribute to the possibility of project implementation.
