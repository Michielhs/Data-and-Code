NSQ (Non-implementation Status Quo):

Overview:
The Non-implementation Status Quo (NSQ) rule is a decision-making framework where Project A is not implemented under any circumstances.

Procedure:

Non-implementation of Project A:

Under the NSQ rule, Project A will not be implemented, regardless of any valuations or decisions made by the group members.

Part 2 Actions:
In Part 2 of the experiment, no further actions are required from the group members. There are no statements or decisions needed concerning Project A since the implementation is already ruled out by the NSQ decision rule.

Result:
Since Project A is not implemented, all group members will receive a payoff of 0 euros. This outcome is fixed and does not depend on any inputs or decisions from the participants during Part 2.
