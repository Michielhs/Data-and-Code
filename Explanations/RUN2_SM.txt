SM (Simple Majority):

Overview:
The Simple Majority (SM) rule involves a voting process by all group members to decide whether to implement Project A.

Procedure:
Voting Process:

Each group member, including you, will vote either for or against the implementation of Project A.
Members will explicitly state their vote as either "for" or "against."

Decision Criteria:
For Project A to be implemented, at least two out of the three group members must vote in favor of implementation.
If fewer than two members vote for implementation, Project A will not be implemented.

Outcome:
The decision to implement or not implement Project A is based solely on the majority vote of the group members.
