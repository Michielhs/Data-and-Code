You are part of a group with 3 members, including yourself and two other participants chosen randomly. Your group has the option to undertake a project, referred to as project A. If the project isn’t undertaken, each member receives no payment. If project A is undertaken, each member receives payment based on their personal valuation of the project. Each member may value project A differently. You won’t know the identities of the other group members.

The decision process has two parts. In the first part, each member suggests one of two decision rules for determining whether project A will be undertaken in the second part. A computer randomly selects one suggestion as the group rule. This rule determines the decision-making process for project A in the second part.

In the second part, the chosen decision rule is used to decide whether project A will be undertaken. The group decision is based on the choices of all members. Payments are then determined and distributed accordingly.

If project A is undertaken, payments are based on individual valuations. If your valuation of project A is positive, you benefit from its implementation; if negative, you incur a cost if the project proceeds. You learn your valuation after part one, so you won’t know it when suggesting decision rules. If project A isn’t undertaken, each member receives no payment, regardless of their valuation.
